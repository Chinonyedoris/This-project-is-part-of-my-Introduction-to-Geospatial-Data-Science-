Map preview👉:QGIS health facilities mapping project:The map integrates:
✅ State, regional, and LGA boundaries 👩‍💻

As part of my ongoing training with DSN - Data Science Nigeria(DSN), I worked on a project using QGIS to create a map showing health facility centers across Nigerian states.

This exercise was an eye-opener into how geospatial analysis can drive impactful decisions in public health planning, accessibility studies, and resource allocation.

As part of my Geospatial Analysis project with QGIS, I explored Nigeria’s boundary datasets, visualizing:
✅ State boundaries
✅ Local Government Area (LGA) boundaries
